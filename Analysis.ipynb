    "\n",
    "The Centre for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) array is an optical inteferometer located one Mount Wilson in California. \n",
    "\n",
    "It consists of six telescopes that can be linked together, arranged in a Y shape with the distance between any two telescopes being unique. The setup is used to improve angular resolutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical theory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optical inteferometry\n",
    "\n",
    "The angular resolution of a telescope is the smallest angle between objects that can be seen to be seperate (the smaller the better). $\\text{angular resolution} \\propto 1/D$ where $D$ is the diameter of the telescope. Therefore, larger telescopes are favoured as they are better at resolving two objects. If you know how far away an object is and how large the features you are trying to observe are you can find the required diameter of the telescope. Often, the required diameter is far too large both practically and economically, this is where telescope arrays become useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using two telescopes together, the angular resolution is set by the distance between the telescopes and not the sizes of the individual telescopes. This means two telescopes that are distance $D$ apart have the same resolving capability (but not light collecting capability) as a larger continuous telescope of diameter $D$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**When using light from a single source such as a star, the light must have travelled an equal distance in each branch to interfere. HOW TO EXPLAIN? **\n",

    "#### Interferometry setup at CHARA\n",

    "![Image of Token](https://www.chara.gsu.edu/files/Tutorials/interferometer_basic.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At CHARA, there are six telescopes of diameter 1m which can be pointed to different part of the sky. The light from these is sent down vacuum tubes to the central Beam Synthesis Facility. The path difference in the two beams has two contributing factors: \n",
    "\n",
    "**External delay** - Generally, the light from a star will arrive at one telescope before the other, as shown in figure X. This introduces a delay that is related to the inner product of the star vector and the baseline vector (the vector joining two telescopes). $\\hat{\\pmb{S}} \\cdot \\pmb{B}$ where $\\pmb{B} = \\pmb{r}_1 - \\pmb{r}_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal delay** - The internal delay has three factors. a) the differing distance to the central beam synthesis facility, this is known as the \"constant term\" b) a mirror on a cart which is computer-controlled and can move with submicron accuracy c) a set of fixed mirrors that add in fixed delays of varying length called \"Pipes of Pans\" (POP) delays. \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the overall equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\pmb{S}} \\cdot (\\pmb{r}_1 - \\pmb{r}_2) + d_1 - d_2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is equal to zero when the paths are of equal distance. When this is true, it is possible to split up the d term and present as below\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CART}_1 - \\text{CART}_2 = \\hat{\\pmb{S}} \\cdot (\\pmb{r}_1 - \\pmb{r}_2) + \\text{POP}_1 - \\text{POP}_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical theory\n",
    "- How if we have a series of measurements and have an equation for each then we have a system of linear equations. This can be put into a matrix form where we are trying to find the model parameter, these are the vectors from some argbitrary origin which we can set as E1 and the pop settings\n",
    "- We have many more equations than unknowns meaning the problem is over determined, explain this with the graph example \n",
    "- Explain how we cannot have exact solution but we can give least squares in parameter space\n",
    "- Why don't we use something else instead of least squares? \n",
    "    - Happens to be the highest likelihood \n",
    "    - also gives linear derivative to solve which is nice \n",
    "    - why do outliers make such a big difference \n",
    "- Maybe give least absolute value a go!\n",
    "- Show the derivation that arrives at the pseudo inverse being the least squares\n",
    "- Pseudoinverse is the least squares problem to A^TA\n",
    "- How does the SVD fit into all of this???\n",

    "\n",
    "### How to implement with the dataset given \n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, we are given 5 sets of data. Each consists of a series of measurements (rows), at which the path difference has been equalised. Below is an example measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|    | utc                     | star   |   azimuth |   elevation | tel_1   | tel_2   | pop_1   | pop_2   |   cart_1 |   cart_2 |\n",

    "\n",
    "From the previous section, it is known that each measurement corresponds to the equation \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{CART}_1 - \\text{CART}_2 = \\hat{\\pmb{S}} \\cdot (\\pmb{r}_1 - \\pmb{r}_2) + \\text{POP}_1 - \\text{POP}_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If each measurement is converted into an equation we can form a matrix equation, as seen below. From here, common data science techniques may be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\pmb{y} = \\pmb{X} \\pmb{\\beta}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting the measurments into a system of equations and then into a matrix equation is known as *pre-processing*. For the conversion of a row into an equation there are the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conversion of star direction unit vector, $\\hat{\\pmb{S}}$, from horizontal (azimuth, elevation) to Cartesian coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find a way of representing the projection of the baseline onto the star vector\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Find a way of representing which POP setting is being used\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Get the output vector, $\\pmb{y}$, as the difference between the carts\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets go through these in order...\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.** the horizontal coordinates are related to Cartesians coordinates via the following equations \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \n",
    "![<img src=\"image.png\" width=\"250\"/>](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.svg/1200px-Azimuth-Altitude_schematic.svg.png) -->\n",
    "\n",
    "$$r = (x,y,z) = (\\cos\\theta \\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta \\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Columns of a DataFrame are vectorised, meaning the equation can be carried out on every line without any `for` loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the transpose of the equation is taken, with `.T`, as originally there are three (2034,) vectors next to each other making the shape (3, 2034). Taking the transpose gets (2034,3) vector which is an array of 2034 3-vectors which is exactly what is wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** we can represent the the telescope using *one-hot encoding*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, as we have categorical data, that cannot be assigned numerical values relative to each other (why). Therefore assigning a column for each unique model parameter is appropriate, as discussed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the telescope this is a column for each of the three $(x,y,z)$ components. Although, we need 15 and not 18 of these columns as one telescopes is the origin (only the relative positions of telescopes can be found). \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking back at the equation which is to be constructed for each measurement, we see that both telescopes are dotted with the star unit vector and the second telescope (`tel_2`) is a negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{\\pmb{S}} \\cdot (\\pmb{r}_{1} - \\pmb{r}_{2}) = S_x (r_{1,x} - r_{2,x}) + S_y (r_{1,y} - r_{2,y}) + S_z (r_{1,z} - r_{2,z})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that every telescope that is present must be dotted with the star unit vector and that the second telescope must have a factor of $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** for the POP settings there are 30 different settings, $PXBY$ with $1 \\leq X \\leq 5$ and  $1 \\leq Y \\leq 6$. But, each setting is unique when used with each telescope. For example, $P1B3$ adds in a different amount of path length when used with $W1$ or $S2$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a general design matrix, each setting was allowed on each telescope i.e. 180 columns. Although this can be reduced massive if the dataset if first checked to see which POP settings each telescope uses and adjusting the number of columns accordingly. Though, compute was not not a limiting factor so this was left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.** Finding the model output vector (i.e. the differnce between the two moveable carts) is trivial and especially simple due to the vectorisation of columns of DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a function that for data with some telescopes and POP settings will create a design matrix of the appropriate size and populate it \n",
    "\n",
